âœ¨ Iâ€™m an engineer student, with a passion for software engineering and coding! Welcome to my GitHub!

Despite not being from the field, currently Iâ€™m immersing myself in the world of software development, as I have two years experience as an intern in the field. Itâ€™s been an exciting journey learning about microservices, database management, and API development.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I am working on an API for my final graduation project that will receive dates and polygons and return the amount of water that area has lost or earn in the years.
